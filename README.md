# Ridge_regrettion_model_from_scratch_house_price_prediction
In this notebook, you will implement ridge regression via gradient descent. You will:
* Convert an SFrame into a Numpy array
* Write a Numpy function to compute the derivative of the regression weights with respect to a single feature
* Write gradient descent function to compute the regression weights given an initial weight vector, step size, tolerance, and L2 penalty
